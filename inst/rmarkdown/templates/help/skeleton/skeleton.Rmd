<!-- Welcome to the template! This comment is here to help you get started. The HTML comments will help you fill it out. Please make sure to do the following:
- make the YAML `title` the topic name. For example, the `filter()` docs are titled `dplyr::filter()` (with backticks since it's code!)
- name the final Rmd file "topic-packagethetopiccomesfrom_topic.Rmd". For example, the `filter()` file is named `topic-dplyr_filter.Rmd`
- If you are considering documenting MULTIPLE TOPICS in a single help Rmd, STOP and CONSULT FIRST with Spielman!!

# Load any INDIVIDUAL libraries here.
# DO NOT, I REPEAT __DO NOT__, LOAD THE FULL TIDYVERSE!! In other words `library(tidyverse)` => ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!! Load only what you need, one at a time.

# If you are using the carnivores dataset, read it in here using this exact code below. 
# If you are using the full msleep dataset, load `ggplot2` as one of your libraries.
#carnivores <- readr::read_csv(
#  system.file("extdata", "carnivores.csv", package = "introverse") 
#)

### Description

The text should be replaced with a plain English and clear description of when and why we use the given topic.

<!-- Add the following if the topic is a function that does NOT come with base R, and uncomment/fill in the subsequent multiline HTML comment: -->
<!--To use this function, you need to either first load the `{NAMEOFPACKAGE}` library, or always use the function with `library::function()` notation.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Load the library
library(REPLACE THIS WITH NAME OF LIBRARY!)

# Or, use :: notation
PUT THE LIBRARY NAME HERE::PUT FUNCTION NAME HERE WITH PARENTHESES AT THE END()
```
-->


### Conceptual usage 



```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Pseudocode examples of use cases, with more appropriate-than-this comments
```


### Examples

<!-- Add this line if your examples use carnivores (but delete this instruction!):
> Need a refresher on the `carnivores` dataset? Run `get_help("carnivores)` for more information.
-->


<!-- Add this line if your examples use msleep (but delete this instruction!):
> Need a refresher on the `msleep` dataset? Run `get_help("msleep)` for more information.
