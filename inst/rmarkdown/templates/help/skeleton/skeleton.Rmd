<!-- Welcome to the template! This comment is here to help you get started. The HTML comments will help you fill it out. Please make sure to do the following:

- Leave the YAML title alone!!!! It's supposed to say that!! Instead, add your title into large HTML code below, as shown. This allows the title to be integrated with the logo
- Make the title the topic name. For example, the filter docs are titled dplyr::filter()
- name the final Rmd file "category_topic.Rmd". For example, the `filter()` file is named `dplyr_filter.Rmd`
-->

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, 
                      warning = FALSE, 
                      message = FALSE)
# Load any INDIVIDUAL libraries here.
# NEVER load the full tidyverse - In other words `library(tidyverse)` => ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!! Load only what you need, _one at a time_.

# Do NOT read in any datasets (carnivores/msleep)!!! It's taken care of, as long as you develop as follows instead of knitting (really, no knitting!) - 
# 1) devtools::load_all()
# 2) get_help("topic youre currently developing")
```

<!-- LEAVE THIS CSS CHUNK ALONE!!! --> 
```{css custom, echo=FALSE}
.title{
    display: none;
}
blockquote {
  display: block;
  font-size: 0.95em;
  border-left: 3px solid #7FB036;
  padding:10px;
  margin-left:10px;
}
```
<!-- LEAVE THIS CSS CHUNK ^^ ALONE!!! -->




<!-- !!!!!!!!!!!ALERT!!!!!! YOU NEED TO ADD YOUR TITLE HERE!!

This is the HTML code that integrates the logo with the title. 

Add your title where it says REPLACE THIS WITH THE TITLE (6th line from the top). Do not change anything else, and do not use any backticks or add any spaces. -->
<div>
<br>
 <img src = "logo.png" style = "float:left;height:130px;margin-top:-20px;">
 <span style = "font-weight:bold;font-size:40px;"> 
  &nbsp;<code>REPLACE THIS WITH THE TITLE</code>
 </span>
 <br>
 <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>{introverse}</code> quick docs</b>
</div>
<br>
<!-- DO NOT DELETE THAT ^^ !!! -->

## Description

The text should be replaced with a plain English and clear description of when and why we use the given topic.

<!-- Add the following if the topic is a function that does NOT come with base R, and uncomment/fill in the subsequent multiline HTML comment: -->
<!--To use this function, you need to either first load the `{NAMEOFPACKAGE}` library, or always use the function with `library::function()` notation.

```{r description, eval=FALSE}
# Load the library
library(REPLACE THIS WITH NAME OF LIBRARY!)

# Or, use :: notation
PUT THE LIBRARY NAME HERE::PUT FUNCTION NAME HERE WITH PARENTHESES AT THE END()
```
-->


## Conceptual usage 

```{r usage, eval=FALSE}
# Pseudocode examples of use cases
```


## Examples

<!-- Add this line if your examples use carnivores (but delete this instruction!):
> Need a refresher on the `carnivores` dataset? Run `get_help("carnivores)` for more information.
-->

<!-- Add this line if your examples use msleep (but delete this instruction!):
> Need a refresher on the `msleep` dataset? Run `get_help("msleep")` for more information.
-->

<!-- Add a <br> if there is NO DATASET REFRESHER!! Otherwise the refresher takes up enough space. -->

```{r example1}
# Brief comment explaining what this example does


```

<br>  <!-- Do not delete the <br>, and make sure to keep the previous and following lines blank. There should be a <br> tab between each example -->


```{r example2}
# Brief comment explaining what this example does

```

<br> <!-- Do not delete the <br>, and make sure to keep the previous and following lines blank. -->

<!-- If needed, add more example chunks below WITH NAMES (example3, example4, etc.), making sure to have a <br> tag in between each example for nicer spacing. If you don't need more examples, don't add any! -->
