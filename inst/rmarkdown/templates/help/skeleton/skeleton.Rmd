<!-- Welcome to the template! This comment is here to help you get started. The HTML comments will help you fill it out. Please make sure to do the following:
- make the YAML `title` "The topic name"
- name the final Rmd file "topic-nameoftopic"
- If you are considering documenting MULTIPLE TOPICS in a single help Rmd, please consult with Spielman **FIRST**!
-->

```{r setup, include = FALSE, }
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
# If your topic is from a library, load the INDIVIDUAL library here.
# DO NOT, I REPEAT __DO NOT__, LOAD THE FULL TIDYVERSE. ONLY LOAD INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES THAT ARE NEEDED.
# IN OTHER WORDS, `library(tidyverse)` <-- ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!!!!!!!


```

<br> <!-- Do not delete the <br>, and make sure to keep the previous and following lines blank. -->

### Description

The text should be replaced with a plain English and clear description of when and why we use the given topic.

<!-- Include the following depending on the circumstance... --> 

<!-- Add this if the topic is a function that does NOT come with base R, and uncomment/fill in the subsequent multiline HTML comment: -->

<!--To use this function, you need to either first load the `{NAMEOFPACKAGE}` library, or always use the function with `library::function` notation.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Load the library
library(REPLACE THIS WITH NAME OF LIBRARY!)

# Or, use :: notation
PUT THE LIBRARY NAME HERE::PUT FUNCTION NAME HERE WITH PARENTHESES AT THE END()
```
-->
