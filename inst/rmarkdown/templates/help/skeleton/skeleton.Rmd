<!-- Welcome to the template! This comment is here to help you get started. The HTML comments will help you fill it out. Please make sure to do the following:
- make the YAML `title` the topic name. For example, the `filter()` docs are titled `dplyr::filter()` (with backticks since it's code!)
- name the final Rmd file "packagethetopiccomesfrom_topic.Rmd". For example, the `filter()` file is named `dplyr_filter.Rmd`
- If you are considering documenting MULTIPLE TOPICS in a single help Rmd, STOP and CONSULT FIRST with Spielman!!

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, 
                      warning = FALSE, 
                      message = FALSE)
# Load any INDIVIDUAL libraries here.
# NEVER load the full tidyverse - In other words `library(tidyverse)` => ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!! Load only what you need, _one at a time_.

# If you need one or both of these datasets, uncomment the relevant line(s).
# _When you are done development and ready to test your file, RE-DELETE THE LINES!!

# Optional DEVELOPMENT-ONLY code to read in msleep
#msleep <- readr::read_csv(
#  system.file("extdata", "msleep.csv", package = "introverse")
#)

# Optional DEVELOPMENT-ONLY code to read in carnivores
#carnivores <- readr::read_csv(
#  system.file("extdata", "carnivores.csv", package = "introverse")
#)
```


## Description

The text should be replaced with a plain English and clear description of when and why we use the given topic.

<!-- Add the following if the topic is a function that does NOT come with base R, and uncomment/fill in the subsequent multiline HTML comment: -->
<!--To use this function, you need to either first load the `{NAMEOFPACKAGE}` library, or always use the function with `library::function()` notation.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Load the library
library(REPLACE THIS WITH NAME OF LIBRARY!)

# Or, use :: notation
PUT THE LIBRARY NAME HERE::PUT FUNCTION NAME HERE WITH PARENTHESES AT THE END()
```
-->


## Conceptual usage 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Pseudocode examples of use cases, with more appropriate-than-this comments
```


## Examples

<!-- Add this line if your examples use carnivores (but delete this instruction!):
> Need a refresher on the `carnivores` dataset? Run `get_help("carnivores)` for more information.
-->

<!-- Add this line if your examples use msleep (but delete this instruction!):
> Need a refresher on the `msleep` dataset? Run `get_help("msleep)` for more information.
-->

<!-- Add a <br> if there is NO DATASET REFRESHER!! Otherwise the refresher takes up enough space. -->

```{r example1}
# Brief comment explaining what this example does


```

<br>  <!-- Do not delete the <br>, and make sure to keep the previous and following lines blank. There should be a <br> tab between each example -->


```{r example2}
# Brief comment explaining what this example does

```

<br> <!-- Do not delete the <br>, and make sure to keep the previous and following lines blank. -->

<!-- If needed, add more example chunks below WITH NAMES (example3, example4, etc.), making sure to have a <br> tag in between each example for nicer spacing. If you don't need more examples, don't add any! -->
