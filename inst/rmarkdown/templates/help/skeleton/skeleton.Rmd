<!-- Welcome to the template! This comment is here to help you get started. The HTML comments will help you fill it out. Please make sure to do the following:
- make the YAML `title` the topic name itself. For example, the docs for `filter()` have the title: "`dplyr::filter()" 
- name the final Rmd file "topic-nameofpackageitcomesfrom_nameoftopic.Rmd". For example, the docs for `filter()` are named `topic-dplyr_filter.Rmd`
- If you are considering documenting MULTIPLE TOPICS in a single help Rmd, please consult with Spielman **FIRST**!

```{r setup, include = FALSE, }
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
# If your topic is from a library, load the INDIVIDUAL library here.
# DO NOT, I REPEAT __DO NOT__, LOAD THE FULL TIDYVERSE. ONLY LOAD INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES THAT ARE NEEDED.
# IN OTHER WORDS, `library(tidyverse)` <-- ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!!!!!!!


```

### Description

The text should be replaced with a plain English and clear description of when and why we use the given topic.

<!-- Add the following if the topic is a function that does NOT come with base R, and uncomment/fill in the subsequent multiline HTML comment: -->
<!--To use this function, you need to either first load the `{NAMEOFPACKAGE}` library, or always use the function with `library::function()` notation.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Load the library
library(REPLACE THIS WITH NAME OF LIBRARY!)

# Or, use :: notation
PUT THE LIBRARY NAME HERE::PUT FUNCTION NAME HERE WITH PARENTHESES AT THE END()
```
-->
