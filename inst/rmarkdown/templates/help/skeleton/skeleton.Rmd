<!-- Welcome to the template! This comment is here to help you get started. The HTML comments will help you fill it out. Please make sure to do the following:
- make the YAML `title` the topic name. For example, the `filter()` docs are titled `dplyr::filter()` (with backticks since it's code!)
- name the final Rmd file "topic-packagethetopiccomesfrom_topic.Rmd". For example, the `filter()` file is named `topic-dplyr_filter.Rmd`
- If you are considering documenting MULTIPLE TOPICS in a single help Rmd, STOP and CONSULT FIRST with Spielman!!

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, 
                      warning = FALSE, 
                      message = FALSE)
# If your topic is from a library, load the INDIVIDUAL library here.
# DO NOT, I REPEAT __DO NOT__, LOAD THE FULL TIDYVERSE. ONLY LOAD INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES THAT ARE NEEDED.
# IN OTHER WORDS, `library(tidyverse)` <-- ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!!!!!!!

# If you are using the `pengs` dataset as part of your code, read it in here -  (Spielman will make sure it's properly read in package-style by final version)
# pengs <- readr::read_csv("path/to/pengs.csv")
```

### Description

The text should be replaced with a plain English and clear description of when and why we use the given topic.

<!-- Add the following if the topic is a function that does NOT come with base R, and uncomment/fill in the subsequent multiline HTML comment: -->
<!--To use this function, you need to either first load the `{NAMEOFPACKAGE}` library, or always use the function with `library::function()` notation.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Load the library
library(REPLACE THIS WITH NAME OF LIBRARY!)

# Or, use :: notation
PUT THE LIBRARY NAME HERE::PUT FUNCTION NAME HERE WITH PARENTHESES AT THE END()
```
-->


### Conceptual usage 

<!-- Please insert either or both of..

+ `bullet points of pseudocode`


```{r, eval=FALSE}
# A chunk of pseudocode with flag eval=FALSE
```

--> 

### Examples

<!-- Delete the following if pengs is not used in any examples:-->

> Need a reminder of the dataset `pengs`? You can see the full dataset with `View(pengs)` and learn more about the dataset with `get_help("pengs")`.


```{r}
# Brief comment explaining what this example does


```

<br>  <!-- Do not delete the <br>, and make sure to keep the previous and following lines blank. There should be a <br> tab between each example -->


```{r}
# Brief comment explaining what this example does

```

<!-- Add more example chunks below, making sure to have a <br> tag in between each example for nicer spacing. There NEEDS TO BE a blank line above and below each <br>! -->
