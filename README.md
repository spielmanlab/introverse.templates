# introverse_templates
Distributes the `{introverse}` templates 


## How to use?

+ Install this package with: `remotes::install_github("spielmanlab/introverse.templates")`
+ Open a new Rmd `{introverse}` help docs template by...
  + `File` -> `New File` (dropdown menu here) -> `R Markdown`
  + On the screen that appears, click the left side menu "From Template"
  + In the list of templates, `Introverse topic help` to open a template Rmd
    + If you don't see this template, you likely didn't install the `{introverse.templates}` package correctly. Re-install with the `remotes` command, quit and re-launch RStudio, and try again to open from template.
    + At this stage, you can set the document title as the name of the topic you are introducing (or you can do this directly in YAML when the template opens)
  + Voila!
 
+ Open a new Rmd `{introverse}` learnr module template by...
  + You can't, it's not ready yet! Forthcoming!
